/*			Notes on Completion
This rendering engine is where I fused my knowledge of Calculus 3 and vector and matrix maths to accomplish a more realistic image with less computation than before.
It does not render faces that are facing away from itself (by checking the gradients).
It calculates the percentage the face is lit up (again, with the gradients between the normal vector to the face and the vector to the viewer).
It also calculates the percentage of light reflected (with the gradients of the normal vector, to the viewer, and to the light).
Due to the fact that I am using the CPU and I don't have supper fast processes, I have not gotten a depth buffer in this so it will just have to do with checking if a face is facing the viewer (more improvment on a later design).
