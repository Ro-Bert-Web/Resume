					Asteroids
				</h1>
				<p>
					For a pass-time I sometimes program games with HTML and Javascript, the most finalized of these being my remaking of asteroids.

				<h1>
					Minesweeper
				</h1>
				<p>
					I programmed a game of minesweeper in Javascript. But to add a small twist, I made it so that it infinitly generates. As you get close to an edge, it generates more tiles in chunks to offer a never ending experience. Simply click on a tile to flag it, or click on a number to clear out any spaces around that aren't flagged. Clicking with the scroll wheel will remove a tile.

					Rendering Engines
				</h1>
				<p>
					As a hobby, I also program multiple itterations of rendering engines with their own new upgrades to the other. I last made one that has the most aesthetically appealing images with light gradients and reflective surfaces. Though it is no where near perfect. It is a major success to where I started with not knowing anything about rendering engines.

					A whole new dimension
				</h1>
				<p>
					After peering into the maths of the fourth dimension and rendering engines, I am working on upgrading my shaders for my rendering engines to work with the fourth dimension. Below I have a link to a paper I wrote up about a shape called the klein bottle. To explain the ideas expressed in the website, I have a fourth dimensional rendering of each example with animation.

					Praciticing Implementation Algorithms
				</h1>
				<p>
					If I am not working on a large scale project, I will sometimes search up different algorithms or concepts and attempt to implement them. I have programmed anything from a simple base converter, to a huffman data compression algorithm.

				<h1>
					Custom Libraries
				</h1>
				<p>
					While I was programming with the Vex Robotics Competition, I programmed a custom library called Competition Language to make the many operations extremely easy and advanced. It contained many functions from a simple wait until, to a function to find the speed of a sensor and even implement that into a simple PID controller.
