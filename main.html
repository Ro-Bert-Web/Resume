				I have programmed a few games, the most finalized one being my remaking of asteroids.

				Rendering Engines
			</h1>
			<p>
				As a hobby, I have programmed several different rendering engines with their own new upgrades to the other. I finished off with one that has the most aesthetically appealing images. Though it is no where near perfect. It is a major success to where I started with not knowing anything about rendering engines.

			<h1>
				A whole new dimension
			</h1>
			<p>
				As I have peered into the maths of the fourth dimension, I have worked on upgrading my shaders for my rendering engines to work with the fourth dimension. Below I have a link to a paper I wrote up about a shape called the klein bottle. In each window is a rendering of some fourth dimensional object using the engine I programmed.
